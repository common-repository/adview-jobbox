AdView Jobbox WordPress Plugin

== Description ==
Add live job adverts to your website using the AdView Jobbox plugin. Setup is quick and easy, with universal sizes suited to any website.
You can select from our recommended sizes, as well as choose a look and feel to compliment your website's design.
Start by registering as a [Publisher on AdView](https://adview.online/publisher "AdView Publisher"), and then integrating this plugin with your website.
When a user of your website clicks on any of the jobs displayed in the AdView Jobbox window, you will be paid a small amount. The amount you are paid per click can vary. We recommend you keep an eye on your reporting dashboard to see how much you have earned over a given period.
You can create jobboxes with custom sizes. Use our [Jobbox Guide](https://adview.online/publisher/intro/jobbox "AdView Jobbox") to visualise all the possible ad sizes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My WordPress Widget shows an error message. What does it mean? =


There are numerous cases that can cause this error. Depending on the error message, it can be related to one of the issues below:

**The selected publisher is invalid**: This error occurs when there is invalid publisher ID parameter in the widget configuration. You need to make sure that you are using the correct Publisher ID, which can be accessed in your AdView publisher account under the [‘Jobbox’](https://adview.online/publisher/jobbox#wordpress "Jobbox”) menu.

= What can I change in the settings of the WordPress widget? =


If you are using a dark background, It is recommended to enable the Light logo option, which displays the AdView logo in the desired manner.

Any Channel considered to be valid in AdView Jobbox plugin once you have defined it in your account.

By default, the widget looks for the ‘keyword’ variable in the URL to extract the user searched term, and will return the related jobs based on this value. It is the same behaviour for the area, and looks for the ‘location’ variable in the URL. You can overwrite these variable names by providing an alternative in the ‘Keyword’ and ‘Area’ variable names. As an example, if your URL structure follows the pattern below, you can overwrite the default variable names by setting the ‘Keyword’ variable name to ‘mykey’ and ‘Area’ variable name to ‘myplace’.

**http://example.com/?mykey=KEYWORD_VALUE&myplace=LOCATION_VALUE**
